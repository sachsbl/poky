# poky
Running annoyingly slow processes in the Cloud using Python, Serverless, and AWS Fargate

Merriam-Webster defines "poky" as "annoyingly slow or dull".  Poky accepts the slow, but rejects the dull! It uses AWS Fargate to orchestrate long-running processes coded in Python.  The setup and deployment is orchestrated using the Serverless framework.  The base project uses image processing as the task performed, but could be customized easily to suit other purposes.
